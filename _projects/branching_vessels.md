This is my BEng Honours project at University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with Vascular Flow Technologies. In this project, I created an automatic workflow using HELYX (OpenFOAM based) and Dakota. Then I validated my simulations against experimental data on the critical conditions where vortices start to form inside the blood vessel bifurcations (Karino and Goldsmith, 1980). The wall shear stress near the region of vortices was studied and a surrogate model for the size of vortices was also proposed.
