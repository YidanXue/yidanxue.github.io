In our work, we developed an event-based in silico trial framework for acute ischemic stroke, integrating multi-scale models of perfusion, intervention, and injury. Our open-source platform generates virtual patient cohorts and enables the investigation of diverse clinical scenarios, demonstrating how in silico trials can complement traditional methods in medical product evaluation and regulation.
