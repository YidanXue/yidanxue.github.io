The brain function depends on the continuous oxygen supply through the bloodstream inside the microvasculature. Occlusions in the microvascular network will disturb the oxygen delivery in the brain and result in hypoxic tissues that can lead to infarction and cognitive dysfunction. To aid in understanding the formation of hypoxic tissues caused by micro-occlusions, I developed mathematical models of oxygen transport in the cerebral microvasculature. For the first time, we quantified the relationship between the loss of micro-vessels and the brain tissue hypoxia {% cite Xue2021 %}. We applied the models in in silico trials for the treatment of ischaemic stroke through collaborations with clinicians, biologists and bioengineers from the EU-funded INSIST project {% cite Miller2021 %}. A follow-up work extended the length scale to a cortical column, where the spatial correlation between occlusions and tissue hypoxic regions were quantified and validated against animal experiments {% cite Xue2022 %}. The cortical column models have also been used to study the transit time distributions, which reflect underlying microvascular structure and flow characteristics {% cite Payne2025 %}.
