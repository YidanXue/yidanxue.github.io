In my DPhil, I developed mathematical models to simulate oxygen transport and hypoxic tissue damage in the human brain. For the first time, I quantified the relationship between the loss of micro-vessels and the brain tissue hypoxia. I validated my models against animal experiments, and applied the models in in silico trials for the treatment of ischaemic stroke through collaborations with clinicians, biologists and bioengineers from the EU-funded INSIST project.
