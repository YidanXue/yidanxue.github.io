The brain function depends on the continuous oxygen supply through the bloodstream inside the microvasculature. Occlusions in the microvascular network will disturb the oxygen delivery in the brain and result in hypoxic tissues that can lead to infarction and cognitive dysfunction. To aid in understanding the formation of hypoxic tissues caused by micro-occlusions, I developed mathematical models of oxygen transport in the cerebral microvasculature. For the first time, I quantified the relationship between the loss of micro-vessels and the brain tissue hypoxia. My models were validated against animal experiments, and applied the models in in silico trials for the treatment of ischaemic stroke through collaborations with clinicians, biologists and bioengineers from the EU-funded INSIST project.
