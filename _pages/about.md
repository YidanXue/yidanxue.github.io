I am a Postdoc at Cardiff University working with Drs Thomas Woolley and Katerina Kaouri on developing an indoor epidemic simulator. I was an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, working on Stokes flows and microparticle transport in micro-vessel bifurcations with Professor Sarah Waters. With Professor Nick Trefethen, we developed a rational approximation algorithm for computing 2D Stokes flows. Before this, I did my DPhil  on modelling oxygen transport and tissue damage in the human brain with Professor Stephen Payne at Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford. I received my BEng (Hons) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Edinburgh.
