I am a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Alex Frangi's group in School of Health Sciences at the University of Manchester. My research focuses on the development of in-silico trials for TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) devices. Prior to this, I held postdoctoral positions in applied mathematics at both Cardiff University and University of Oxford. I did my DPhil on modelling oxygen transport and tissue damage in the human brain with Professor Stephen Payne at Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford. I received my BEng (Hons) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Edinburgh.
